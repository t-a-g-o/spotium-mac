Spotium does not include any viruses, backdoors, trojans, or any other type of malicious software or code. Additionally, Spotium rarely updates but when it does it is important, Spotium checks for updates automatically. You can view the latest Spotium files VirusTotal result for windows and for macOS. Spotium has gone to macOS thanks to some inspiration from [BlockTheSpot](https://github.com/Nuzair46/BlockTheSpot-Mac/tree/main). Spotium has gone open source to further prove that there are no viruses, and to allow the community to contribute.
